# MRT Routes Finder

**The MRT is Singapore's urban rail system. Your task is to build a React app to help users plan MRT journeys, which may include walking and changing trains at various stops. The app should have the following minimal functionality:**
* Users enter their origin and destination autocomplete
* The app displays a list of routes, with the best one first
* The user selects a route to view the detailed steps in that route

To begin working on the project, run  npm install  and then  npm start . To run automated tests, run  npm test .
